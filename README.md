# AI Village
A study of relationship between different AI agents in a adverserial and collaborative environment.

This is a project where the LLMs control the actions of the villagers in a village. The villagers will follow a time-table set by the LLM based on the characteristics and memory of each agent. When the agents meet, they start up a conversation. This conversation will affect the memory and behaviour of both agents.
